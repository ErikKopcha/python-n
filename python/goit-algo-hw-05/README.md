## Conclusions

### 1. Overall Winner: Boyer-Moore

**Boyer-Moore** consistently outperformed both competitors:

- **8.7x faster** than KMP
- **10.1x faster** than Rabin-Karp
- Won in **all 8 test scenarios**

### 2. Key Findings

#### Boyer-Moore Advantages

- Right-to-left scanning enables large jumps on mismatch
- Bad character heuristic is highly effective with natural text
- Particularly efficient when pattern doesn't exist (5-35x faster than alternatives)
- Best performance across all pattern types and lengths

#### KMP Performance

- Moderate speed (8.7x slower than Boyer-Moore)
- Predictable O(n+m) complexity
- LPS array computation adds overhead
- Particularly slow on non-existing patterns (0.099-0.145s)

#### Rabin-Karp Performance

- Slowest overall (10.1x slower than Boyer-Moore)
- Hash computation overhead for every position
- Hash collisions require full string comparison
- Not recommended for single pattern search

### 3. Pattern-Specific Insights

**Short patterns** (e.g., "пошук"):

- Boyer-Moore maintains consistent advantage
- All algorithms perform reasonably well

**Long patterns** (e.g., "структури даних"):

- Boyer-Moore shows dramatic advantage
- Longer patterns allow bigger jumps on mismatch

**Non-existing patterns** (biggest performance gap):

- Boyer-Moore: 0.005-0.008s
- KMP: 0.099-0.145s (**19-24x slower**)
- Rabin-Karp: 0.117-0.175s (**23-35x slower**)

### 4. Practical Recommendations

**Use Boyer-Moore when:**

- Single pattern search in text
- Natural language processing
- Pattern length > 2-3 characters
- Performance is critical
- Pattern might not exist in text

**Use KMP when:**

- Need guaranteed worst-case performance
- Streaming data (can't backtrack)
- Working with binary data

**Use Rabin-Karp when:**

- Multiple pattern search
- Plagiarism detection
- NOT for single pattern search

### 5. Why Boyer-Moore Dominates

1. **Cyrillic alphabet advantage**: Large alphabet size (33+ characters) makes bad character rule extremely effective
2. **Smart skipping**: Can skip large portions of text when mismatch occurs
3. **Natural text characteristics**: Real-world text patterns favor Boyer-Moore's heuristics
4. **Minimal overhead**: No complex preprocessing like KMP's LPS array
5. **Non-match efficiency**: Excels when pattern doesn't exist

### 6. Theoretical vs Practical

| Algorithm   | Theoretical   | Practical            |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Boyer-Moore | O(nm) worst   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| KMP         | O(n+m) always | ⭐⭐⭐ Good          |
| Rabin-Karp  | O(n+m) avg    | ⭐⭐ Moderate        |

**Key takeaway**: Theoretical worst-case complexity doesn't predict real-world performance. Boyer-Moore's practical optimizations outweigh theoretical concerns.

---

## Final Verdict

For Ukrainian (Cyrillic) text search, **Boyer-Moore is the clear winner** with 8-10x better performance. The larger alphabet actually helps Boyer-Moore's bad character rule work even better.

**Production recommendation: Use Boyer-Moore** for text search unless you have specific requirements for KMP (streaming) or Rabin-Karp (multiple patterns).
